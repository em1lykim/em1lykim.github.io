        <h2>Context</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-section-content">
        <p>Let me set the scene. You are a college student and want to be tuned in to the free food listserv for a quick
          snack on the way to class. You join the Free Food GroupMe group and get bombarded with free foods in different
          areas of campus. You begin to realize that you are not using it as frequently than you imagined. Why is this
          the
          case?</p>
        <p>GroupMe is a great app that has no restrictions on the number of members in a group. It also has flexibility
          of
          being able to send group texts using the carrier's SMS. However, it can be difficult to gauge when the comment
          was
          posted and how much free food is left, if at all. I began to wonder if there was a better platform to
          emphasize
          those features in a new app.</p>

        <!-- People Problem -->
        <p>This brings us to the People Problem.
          When I receive free food notifications on Cornell campus, I want to pick up a snack on the way to a class, but
          I
          can't do that well because…</p>
        <ol>
          <li>There are too many posts and the posts are disorganized</li>
          <li>I do not know how much food is left since the post was made</li>
          <li>Too many comments and questions following the post makes the initial post buried and difficult to
            continuously
            scroll up</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My hypothesis was that if there was an <strong class="freetery-color">app that emphasized time and
            location</strong> for different
          posts, it would
          <strong class="freetery-color">encourage users to participate more often in free food events</strong> and plan
          their schedule around it.

      <div class="case-study-section-title">
        <h2>Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-section-content">
        <p>User research consists of two core activities: observation and interviews. Due to the time restraint of this
          hackathon challenge, I decided to focus on secondary research on students' interaction on the Free Food
          GroupMe
          chat in order to better understand their desires, challenges, and why the current solution is not working
          well.

          I wanted to delve deeper into the motivation behind joining the Free Food GroupMe and why there was a
          disconnect
          between joining the group and why people do not stop by and pick up the food at the event.</p>
        <p>Some of the key insights that I found were that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>People want to pick up the free food but find it too difficult to coordinate well with all the different
            buildings they have to go to</li>
          <li>People are afraid that by the time they go to the free food, it will already be gone and it would be
            irritating because of the wasted time</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I searched the internet in hopes of finding what similar apps are currently out there. Most of the options
          that
          came up were not free food locators but were food delivery apps, restaurant locators, and food shopping apps.
          Some
          of my key takeaways included:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Emphasis on images</li>
          <li>Data that is easily filterable</li>
          <li>Location is prominent for each food item</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study-section">
      <div class="case-study-section-title">
        <h2>Design Goal</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-section-content">
        <p>I created a list of “How might we's…” to better understand the user's tasks and needs</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How might we better organize the free food uploads so that it is easy for users to find?</li>
          <li>How might we utilize
            location and time so that it coordinates well with a student's schedule?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How did I get here?</h3>


        <p>My initial concept stems from combining a student's calendar and the location of the free food posts and it
          will
          show the path with the shortest route with the free food posts along the way. It will take into account the
          timing
          of when the post was made as well as the relative location of all the buildings that the classes are in. It
          will
          have the option of showing all the free food options as well as the ones that are closest to proximity to my
          schedule. After discussing with backend, it will require both Google Maps api and Google Calendar api and the
          complexity is not reasonable within the time span of the hackathon challenge. I decided to scratch this idea
          and
          pursued a social media inspired app layout. It will have posts that contain photos of the food, the time it
          was
          posted, a status bar that shows how much food is left, and a time of when the post was updated.</p>

        <p>Revising from my first idea, I came up with social media app style where each post is a new free food upload.
          I
          met with my team and I presented and explained my thought-process for my low-fidelity diagram. From the people
          problem, this app must prioritize a filter feature (based on time, location, and allergens), the time when it
          was
          posted, and a status bar that indicates the amount of food remaining.</p>

        <p>Rather than implementing a built in calendar, displaying all the food options is a better solution because of
          the
          unpredictability of new events or office hours that may pop up. Furthermore, it provides more flexibility to
          the
          user if they have preferences for certain types of food or have dietary restrictions.

          It will also include a map display of the free food locations. From my user
          research, this still fits with the People Problem since it will visually show all the current free food
          options
          on
          the map.</p>

        <h2>Iterations</h2>

        <p>This is what my low-fidelity diagram looked like:</p>
        <img src="./images/freetery-lofi.jpg" alt="Freetery Low-Fidelity">

        <!-- <p>One feature that I initially wanted to include was having other people be able to change the status bar so that
      it does not bind the person who posted the free food to stay at that location until all the food is gone. However,
      after speaking with backend, this may present security issues if people decide to take the rest of the leftover
      food. I agreed on their point, so I changed to including a time update feature where the post will indicate 'x
      minutes ago'. This will ensure that there is good updated “communication” between the person who posted and people
      who want the food. It will also not bind the person to stay there especially if there is a small portion left.</p> -->

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first project focusing on creating my own design system. In design, focusing on quantity over
          quality
          helps diversify our solution spaces, allowing us to consider unexpected possibilities. This seems
          counterintuitive
          from how I approached problems growing up where quality over quantity was heavily emphasized. One of the
          first hurdles I ran into was how to display allergens; I wasn't sure what format to go with. After making lots
          of
          explorations (even if I wasn't fully satisfied with one of them) and analyzing the pros/cons of each helped me
          decide what I liked/didn't like and resulted in choosing the best option for one final quality iteration.
        </p>

        <h3>Moving Forward</h3>

        <p>
          There is a still a lot more to explore with Freetery. What if it wasn't limited to Cornell University, but
          other
          universities around the world? What if it expanded to companies and industries? What if the app could sync the
          events on your calendar and maps out the best route to grab free food based on the location of your events?
