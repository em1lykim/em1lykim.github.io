  <div class="case-study-main-content" id="venmo-main-content">

    <p>Towards the end of 2021, I went on a road trip with a couple of friends to Chicago. The bill came out quite
      complicated, accounting for AirBnB stay, restaurants, and other activities. My friend calculated how much each of
      should pay via Excel and the calculator built into his phone, sent a photo of how the bill was split to us, and
      then
      used Venmo at the end to make the money transfer.</p>
    <p>I began to wonder if there was a more efficient way to split bills and if other Venmo users ran into this hassle
      as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>The Venmo app allows users to request and send money to your friends or businesses, all within a social circle.
      Unfortunately, while the app's interface is simple and easy to use, splitting bills has been tedious and
      unintuitive.</p>

    <!-- People Problem -->
    <h2>People Problem</h2>
    <p>When I am making group payments in Venmo, I want to split expenses easily so I can pay back everyone accurately.
      But I can't do that well because:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It's hard to keep track of who paid for what expense, who owes who and how much</li>
      <li>It's difficult and time-consuming to make group payments
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I recruited my two friends, Michael and Tim, to help me brainstorm some potential solutions.</p>
    <img src="./images/venmo_group_photo.jpg" alt="Venmo Group Photo">

    <!-- Solutions -->
    <p>After categorizing and going through viable solutions, I narrowed down to three ideas:</p>
    <p>1. Digitalizing and Storing Receipts</p>
    <p>This feature would allow users to take photos of the receipts and share them with everyone in the group. This is
      useful for users if they lose receipts or forget about transactions. It would increase efficiency with sorting
      orders with multiple people, but utilizing computer vision and camera features would cause some concern about
      accuracy and how easy it is to implement. After conducting user interviews, people were skeptical of the idea
      since
      some receipts are online and also across different platforms.</p>

    <p>2. Custom Changes within Group Payment</p>
    <p>This feature allows users to make custom deductions or pay for people within a group payment. We felt that Venmo
      does not easily support paying for other people or making custom deductions based on their relationship with the
      person. Unfortunately, this may discourage users from utilizing Venmo since privacy is a big concern.</p>

    <p>3. Split Calculation</p>
    <p>One of the biggest key pain points of users is splitting bills because most choose to split by orders and
      therefore
      this feature would cater to the users' needs. Although there is currently a way to link Splitwise to Venmo, we
      felt
      that directly having the calculator features on Venmo would be more user-friendly because it reduces the number of
      clicks to transfer between apps. Including a customizable way to split group payments gives users flexibility to
      easily calculate who owes who and how much.</p>

    <p>Comparing the pros and cons of each idea, I decided to go with the “Split Calculation Feature” because it has the
      highest feasibility and highest impact.</p>

    <h2>Understanding How Users Currently Split Bills</h2>
    <P>There are two main groups of users when it comes to splitting bills:</P>

    <ol>
      <li>Users that use Splitwise to split the bills and then complete the transaction over on Venmo</li>
      <li>Users that punch in the numbers on their calculator and hope that it is accurate</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>User Testing</h2> <!-- ask emily about this-->
    <h2>Feature Requirements — Why Include an Even Bill Split Option if Venmo Already has One?</h2>
    <p>Since my “custom split” feature follows a more complicated flow and the pop-ups are different, it would make more
      sense to have the “even split” flow parallel to the custom one so that users have familiarity and of how both
      flows would realistically work in the app.</p>

    <h2>Selecting Multiple Users</h2>
    <p>
      Through user testing, I noticed that users would find it more convenient to use the app if there was a multiple
      checkbox option to select everyone at once. However, I chose not to design this for two reasons:

    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>It is most consistent with Venmo's current UI and since the “custom split” would be a significant change to
        the UX experience, I prioritized consistency so that users would better smoothly adjust to this new feature
      </li>
      <li>I did not want to replace the iconic “Pay or Request” button on the homepage and first selecting the user
        allows users to use it normally and Venmo one person.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Visual Design: Name Layout After Creating Group</h2>
    <img src="./images/venmo-group-creation.png" alt="Venmo Group Creation">
    <p>Option A is in the same layout for the receipt summary screen while Option B is more consistent with Venmo's
      current UI. After user testing, I found that users would prefer consistency and not having to scroll down the page
      if there are many users to double check who is included in the group. Therefore, I decided to go with Option B.
    </p>

    <h2>How Wording Changes Everything</h2>
    <img src="./images/venmo-wording.png" alt="Venmo Wording">
    <p>During user testing, users were confused by what “total” and “grand total” referred to (Option C). I chose Option
      D because the wording is more clear since subtotal refers to a calculation that is part of a larger total sum
      while total refers to the final, overall sum. In this case, subtotal is a better fit since “extras” must be added.
      This is similar to the wording found on a bill at a restaurant, therefore more users would be able to understand
      Option D better.</p>

    <img src="./images/venmo-payment-selection.png" alt="Venmo Payment Selection">
    <p>One of my key aspects of my feature is to have a way for the user to change who paid to prevent the user who paid
      the bill to always having to split the bill and Venmo request everyone. My initial design is shown in the first
      screen, however, through user research and testing, the visual design was not consistent with Venmo's interface,
      and it took up too much space on the screen. I browsed around the Venmo app to see how pop-ups are shown and an
      example is shown in the second screen above. For my high-fidelity, I chose to present the information shown in the
      third and fourth screens above.</p>

    <h2>A Feedback I Didn't Expect</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "I was a bit confused with the “Share With” icon because I thought it was a feature to share it on social
      media"
    </blockquote>
    <p>Based on this user feedback, I did icon design explorations and came up with the following four icons:</p>
    <img src="./images/venmo-icons.png" alt="Venmo Icons">
    <p>Option E was the one used for user testing and it is similar to social media share icons such as the one used for
      TikTok. Option F may indicate “distributing money” rather than evenly splitting the cost of an item. Option G
      represents evenly splitting as well as fits Venmo's simple interface so this option was chosen for high-fidelity
      prototyping. Option H seemed to be Option G but a complicated version so I did not pursue this design.</p>

    <h2>Combining It All Together</h2>

    <!-- <h2>How Does This Feature Fit in Venmo's simple concept idea?</h2>
    <p>Although splitting a group bill itself is a complicated process, I discovered through user testing that this
      feature still allows users to use Venmo as before (Venmo-ing one user at a time). Users said that they would use
      the feature if they are comfortable with it and people who want to utilize the “custom split” feature will do so
      and people who do not want to, this feature will not change or complicate what they have been doing.</p> -->

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Venmo users struggle with the tediousness of splitting group bills. I hope that this feature can lessen the
      headache of splitting group payments while allowing people to “change people's relationships with money and each
      other”.</p>
