    <h2>Why I decided to make a bold career move from Food Science to UX Design.
    </h2>
    <p>I love cooking. Beyond making food delicious, I wanted to understand the “why” of textural and color changes
      during thermal processing. I wanted to understand how and why starches gelatinize and why my roux thickens with
      starch and heat. I wanted to understand what properties give the biscuits structure and how might substituting an
      ingredient would change its flavor profile and texture. This started my journey of pursuing a degree in food
      science.</p>
    <p>The perception of a food science career changes widely on who you ask. Some see it as “culinary magic” and making
      food taste great, while others see it as a form of technology that is ruining the traditional ways of eating. </p>
    <p>However, not quite.
      Yes, lab work is a significant part of food science, however, the steps to how we got to the lab work is far more
      important. At its core, food science is about people and understanding the lifestyle and ingredients that support
      the culture and foods that they eat. </p>
    <p>I would like to guide you and draw parallels between food science and UX design through a food product
      development competition I participated in in 2021. I will reference the five elements of the design process:
      empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The theme of this competition was to create an innovative food. I
      focused on the sensory and marketing/economic feasibility of this project. </p>
    <!-- insert icon for empathize -->
    <p>Before getting our hands dirty with lab work, we first had to step back and analyze the market trends and see
      what is currently out there. We saw that during the Covid-19, consumers preferred convenience such as ready-to-eat
      snacks. They also became more conscious about the nutritional profile and stayed away from high fat, sodium, and
      preservatives and coloring.</p>
    <!-- Insert icon for define -->
    <p>We established a clear idea of what concept we wanted to target. We wanted it to be a niche product that caters
      to Gen Z and Millennials and heavily focuses on healthy and sustainable factors. </p>

    <!-- Insert icon for ideate -->
    <p>With the market trends in mind, we decided to move forward with a vegan charcuterie snack pack. During this
      process, I analyzed competitors on the market. Our product does not have any direct competitors because there is
      currently no charcuterie packs with both vegan salami and vegan cheese. We highly considered using fermented
      ingredients because of its ingredient novelty and nutritional benefits, but we were not sure of the food safety or
      food chemistry aspect and would have to explore deeper during the prototype stage. </p>

    <!-- Insert icon for prototype -->
    <p>Our vegan “cheese” prototype consisted of using fermented tofu and gums. We quickly found during our bench top
      formulation that it caused the cheese to turn an undesirable gelatinous texture. We reached out to Cornell food
      science professors and gave some feedback on how to improve. We increased the flour content and decreased the gum
      ratio. We saw significant improvement in texture. Our vegan “salami” prototype consisted a base of soya chunks,
      defatted soy flour that has a chewy texture, similar to a dried meat product.
      These two prototypes were technically challenging because how well we balance the level of ingredients in the
      formula relates to the likability of the product. When making these prototypes, we had to constantly keep in mind
      the consumers who are tasting this and the experience we are delivering to them. This includes scenarios of
      when/how they will consume it as well as the serving size and thickness of the slices of cheese and salami. </p>

    <!-- Insert icon for test -->
    <p>After creating all of our samples, we conducted a sensory test similar to a usability testing for design in order
      to see what attributes that people liked and disliked, how much they liked/disliked it on a hedonic scale, and
      collecting data as to whether people would purchase it. Based on this data, we would reconvene and discussed what
      went wrong and how we can move forward with improving our product. We found that the salami color was too dark for
      consumers’ liking and there was a lack in umami flavor. Combining both soya chunks and the bake process caused our
      product to be brown, which can seem unappealing to eat. As for the color, we tested out varying ratios of beet
      juice and vegetable broth to enhance the redness of the salami. Conducting more research, we found that
      fermentation is a good option and it enhanced the “meaty” texture and flavor profile. In the end, we conducted two
      in-person sensory tests and found a 61% increase from the first sensory test of likability in both of our samples.
    </p>

    <p>I realized these skills that I have been honing through college years and during my internships are highly
      transferable. Those include problem-solving, testing, changing prototypes, and testing again. A big portion of
      creating a new product both in competitions and in corporate environments is the ability to communicate what I am
      working on, how I am doing it and why it might not be working and the ability to troubleshoot and figure out
      another alternative. Science encompasses trial and error and the ability to explore multiple options and different
      combinations of ingredients. This runs parallel to creating multiple explorations and determining the pros and
      cons of each design. </p>
    <p>Through a digital product design class at Cornell, I came to love design, a form of problem-solving similar to
      the ways food science solves the world’s food issues whether it is plant-based burgers or a new snack that
      combines healthy and sustainability. Whether we are ready or not, the world is constantly changing. It didn’t seem
      long ago that computers were introduced to the world and now rapidly shifting to AR/VR experiences. Mobile and web
      usage are are an integral part of our daily lifestyle. I want to be a part of this change and making meaningful
      changes to society. I want to create interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but prioritizes key pain
      points and enhances their experience. It is high priority for me to work on projects that solves the real world
      problems rather than solely for ___. </p>
    <!-- replace word above ^ -->

    <p>I want to change paths and go into UX because I want to be able to make efficient, relevant experiences for the
      users.
      At its root, food science and UX focuses on the people. It starts with understanding what users need and want, and
      then circles back to making sure that the new prototype satisfies users. The experience, whether it is a dessert
      or an interface, drives customer satisfaction. Without putting people first, we are unable to create quality
      product that attracts new consumers or make people coming back for more. In order to create quality product, we
      must understand what consumers need so that we can cater to them and focus on what’s most important in the
      formulation. </p>
    <p>At first glance, food science and UX design seem worlds apart. One is within the agriculture community and the
      other focuses on the fast-paced world of tech. Both heavily emphasize the non-linear process of creating a new
      product, both from a people-driven standpoint as well as from a business side. Despite that, my abilities to
      identify the key problem, troubleshoot and not being afraid to explore many options can add value to my work as a
      UX designer. In experiments and in design, fear can hold us back. We want to be correct and having inconsistent
      data or end product not being what is expected can be frustrating. Not me though. I embrace those opportunities
      because it is a wonderful learning experience about why it didn’t work and how I can make it better. I am ready to
      bring those skills and delve into UX design. </p>
